I chose to implement a Random Forest, also known as Ensemble, model with a dataset of house prices based on house features. The data consists of different facets of a house (Kaggle.com Overview). This includes the square footage, if a garage exists, the lot area, if the street is paved, and many more descriptions of a house. There are 79 total features in the training and testing set with 1461 and 1460 samples respectively. Using this data, the model builds a decision tree by determining the best split for each decision node until some conditions are met. In order to prevent overfitting and increase testing accuracy X number of decision trees are created, this is called the Random Forest. Given a set of data each tree in the Forest can predict the cost of each sample in the data. These predictions are averaged to obtain the final prediction for that sample. </p><hr><h3>Design</h3><div class=\\\"overflow-hidden\\\" style=\\\"max-height:40vh;\\\"><div class=\\\"container px-5 text-center\\\"><img src=\\\"\" + _imports_1 + \"\\\" class=\\\"img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow-lg mb-4\\\" alt=\\\"Example image\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\"></div></div><p class=\\\"pt-4\\\"> The website is built similar to any other, see the censored image above.
