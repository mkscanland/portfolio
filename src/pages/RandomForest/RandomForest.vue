          In this project a Random Forest model is presented using Information Gain and Entropy for each split on a decision tree. A "batch" method is used to build each decision tree in the forest. The model creates X number of decision trees and calculates the average of each prediction to determine a best estimate. The best accuracy recorded is: 79.22%. It took 42 minutes to build the forest with 96MB of memory used. However, adjusting the hyperparameters further may help.

            <p>
              A decision tree consists of several <q>Node</q> classes. Every Node contains the variables; left, right, data, key, name, numSamples, isString, and colHeaders. The left and right variables are also meant to be Node classes which, for the purpose of this project, are nodes to separate data on a split. The data, key, and name variables store information to determine a split on prediction. numSamples is the number of samples in this Node, mainly used for information output. isString tells if the feature column that this node is split on contains String objects (True if it is a String). colHeaders provide the column headers for this set of data since the order of the features is randomized.

            <h4 class="fst-italic">Splitting</h4>
            <p>
              To determine the best split the algorithm takes into consideration the current node's data and returns the optimal data column that the split should be made. This is done by determining the information gain, using a simple Entropy algorithm. If the feature with the best information gain only contains the <q>NA</q> value for each sample None values are returned to indicate there is no best split.<br>
              During the splitting process samples are placed into left and right data arrays along with their training targets. The left array contains values that are equivalent to the best split value for categorical features, and it contains values that are less than or equal to the best split value for numerical features, or <q>NA</q> values.

            <p>
              Hyperparameters are the parameters when building a Random Forest that can help to fine-tune predictions. A break-down of each hyperparameter follows:

          <div class="p-4 border-bottom bg-light rounded">
            <ul>
              <li>
                numTrees -- Increases accuracy but increases computational time.
                <ul>
                  <li>Think of this parameter as increasing the number of people you go to for advice about a topic. The more voices you get the more information you can parse through to make an accurate observation. However, the more people you talk to increases the time it takes to make the observation.</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                maxDepth -- Increases the accuracy as maxDepth increases, up to a certain amount
                <ul>
                  <li>This parameter can be tuned for a set of data. A decision tree is able to split a certain number of times until there is no more information to be gained from a split. In the house pricing index data the optimal maximum depth is around 25, depending on the random features selected.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>This parameter can be tuned to decrease the correlation between each of the trees which strengthens the Random Forest increasing accuracy. The normal optimal value for this parameter in a regression problem is M/3, where M is the number of features (Breiman, Leo, 2001). However, I found that roughly M/4 works well for this data set.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>This parameter simply prevents overfitting by restricting the minimum number of samples allowed on each node for a split. With categorical features this parameter doesn't get used often. However, with numeric features the parameter helps to prevent a leaf node containing a small amount of data points.</li>

                  <li>The minimum information gain required for a node to split can help with overfitting. However, if it's set to a value that is too high it will begin to underfit the data and prevent the tree from growing to it's best height.</li>

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of this project is to choose a model that will suit a dataset that the student finds interesting. I chose to implement a Random Forest, also known as Ensemble, model with a dataset of house prices based on house features. The data consists of different facets of a house (Kaggle.com Overview). This includes the square footage, if a garage exists, the lot area, if the street is paved, and many more descriptions of a house. There are 79 total features in the training and testing set with 1461 and 1460 samples respectively.<br><br>
            Using this data, the model builds a decision tree by determining the best split for each decision node until some conditions are met. In order to prevent overfitting and increase testing accuracy X number of decision trees are created, this is called the Random Forest. Given a set of data each tree in the Forest can predict the cost of each sample in the data. These predictions are averaged to obtain the final prediction for that sample.

            The Random Forest model is based on creating several decision trees and comparing their results for the best prediction. The process for creating the forest follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The algorithm begins constructing decision trees one by one, randomizing the data columns for each tree to consider into K batches.</li>
            <li>Among the k features a decision tree is built by calculating the best split point.</li>
            <li>This splits the data into two nodes based on the feature with the best information gain.</li>
            <li>Steps 1-3 are repeated until some maximum depth is reached or minimum samples condition is met.</li>
            <li>Steps 1-4 are repeated until X number of decision trees are created.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            After the Random Forest creation, targets can be predicted from any number of samples. The predictions algorithm simply takes each of the decision trees in the Random Forest and averages each prediction for that sample to give a robust prediction value. In the case of Classification (rather than the previously stated Regression) instead of taking the average, the robust prediction is determined by a majority vote.
          </p>

          <h3>Overview and Data Analysis</h3>
          <p class="pt-4">
            The program starts by grabbing samples and targets from the CSV file. This function simply retrieves the data from the CSV and organizes it into arrays for training features, training samples, and testing features. Some unnecessary columns are removed from the training and testing sets.<br>
            This unnecessary data is found and manually determining which features should be removed. Any features with a relatively very small (&lt;0.006) amount of information gain are removed. After removing these features a more consistent accuracy is observed.<br>
            The Random Forest starts by creating X trees based on the numTrees variable in a for loop. The data is randomized by selecting k (k = M/numBatches, M = total number of features) features in each <q>batch</q>. Each tree is appended to the forest list. This list is returned after numTrees have been created.<br>
            Every decision tree begins with a set of training data which is fed into a <q>buildTree</q> function. This is a recursive function which first checks some conditions to determine if it should return a prediction or another Node; the maximum depth of the tree has not been reached and if this node has enough samples (line 275). If these two conditions are met the algorithm attempts to split the node into a left node and a right node. Upon splitting, if the samples don't consist of only <q>NA</q> values, the algorithm calls the <q>buildTree</q> function for the left and right nodes and their respective data. Otherwise it creates a prediction leaf node. This process is repeated until the maximum depth has been reached or there aren't enough samples to split.<br>
            After the Random Forest is created the accuracy is tested with some training samples that were set aside for testing.

          <h3>Results</h3>

            <b>Best Results:</b><br>
            The best results in terms of accuracy occur at a large number of trees with a maximum depth of 25 and 4 batches. Although these were the best results, they don't show the optimal hyperparameters. Building the forest takes 42 minutes. Unless time isn't a concern in building the model or prediction this isn't optimal. A submission that I posted to Kaggle received a root mean squared score of 0.30734.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Optimal Results:</b><br>
            The optimal results occur when the; number of trees is large (~50), maximum depth is roughly 25, number of batches is 4, and the minimum sample restrictions is 35. These optimal parameters were found by first increasing the maximum depth until the error rate plateaued. The minimum sample restrictions are specific to the data provided by my best guess from trial and error, it was chosen to be ~35. The number of batches is optimal at M/3. However, at 4 batches it was observed that the error rate is more consistent.<br><br>
            The hyperparameters in regards to computational time is dynamic. Less trees and a shallower depth are better for faster computational time. However, if your goal is to increase accuracy, more trees and a depth of ~25 is the best. Therefore, as the number of trees and maximum depth in the forest increases, so does the computational time and memory used.
