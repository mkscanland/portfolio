          I am a skilled software engineer with 4+ years of experience. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for leading technical projects, as well as for creating innovative web applications, I have a verifiable history of contributing directly to growth and expansion throughout my career. As such, I have consistently exceeded performance goals and I am adept at achieving maximum operational output with minimal resource expenditure. Professional focal points also include software development and backend design expertise, as well as numerous facets of tech tools and analytics excellence. Delivering superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires utilization of effective communication skills, as well as resource management to support efficiency and maximum results.<br>
          Currently, I am a Software Engineer at the Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Tech. In this capacity, I design and develop web applications for the external and internal websites. I also have been recognized for improving custom-built PHP framework by modifying SQL queries and data retrieval algorithms. My role has allowed me to craft a number of solutions to facilitate automation efforts, database backups, and the optimization of performance and space requirements. I have additionally demonstrated superior team collaboration skills in deploying and maintaining Docker containers, Apache web servers, and SharePoint/Azure cloud storage. Furthermore, I liaise with senior leadership and departmental teams to ensure the center’s support structure is driving progress forward with minimal expenditures.<br>

                  I also research various IT and software subjects for my job. Most of the time I need to learn best practices before I'm able to work on another application for the CPES websites and IT systems. Preparing for most situations and truly learning a subject before implementing a new system has saved a lot of time and man-hours in the future.

                      Programs should be simple enough to use without being forced to read a manual.<br>
                      Users should be able to become familiar with the product, but they should also be able to use the product easily right away. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to reach a specific part of an application or website, only to have to click through buttons for three minutes. Shortcuts should be present while not being intrusive. I ensure that my programs are intuitive throughout their usage.

                      The looks and usability of a product have a large affect on user experience and the feel arguably has the largest impact on that user's experience.<br>
                      When someone uses a product their final judgement is based on how they felt after accomplishing their task. Although functionality is very important providing a pleasurable experience should be a large goal. I try to provide this by focusing on the users feel of the product as well as the functionality.

                      Responding to user input is critical in developing easy-to-use applications. Working with the user rather than for the user can improve their experience. For example, users should be able to see when the application is processing data or when a button has been clicked. Showing that the program is working through a task can help with impatience and has a calming effect.
